# Car Class and Price Prediction
## Introduction
This project aims to develop machine learning model for predicting Class and Price of cars.
The model will utilize advanced techniques such as data normalization, outlier detection and handling, handling data in the wrong format,
identifying the distribution of features, and leveraging classification based models, specifically the logistic regression algorithm,
to predict the car class accurately.

## Steps involved
* Explored Null values and treated them
* Transformed the data into a suitable format and performing any necessary cleaning and pre-processing steps.
* Explored skewness and outliers in the dataset and are treated with log_transformation, capping outliers and
  visualization is also provided.
* Developed a machine learning classification model which predicts the Status: bus,opel-manta,saab, van and price as well.

## Requirements
This project requires the following libraries to be installed:

* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scipy
* fast_ml
* Scikit-learn
* vs code with jupyter extension

## Getting Started
* Clone the repository.
* Install the required libraries.
* Run the vs-code with jupyter extension or thefile is provided in repo also.
